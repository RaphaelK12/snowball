Monotonic smoothing splines

The goal is to provide a scala implementation of:

M. Egerstedt and C. Martin. [Monotone Smoothing Splines](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/Papers/MonoSplines.pdf). Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems. Perpignan, France, June 2000.

or possibly:

M. Nagahara, Y. Yamamoto, C. Martin, [Quadratic Programming for Monotone Control Theoretic Splines](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clyde_Martin/publication/224182849_Quadratic_programming_for_monotone_control_theoretic_splines/links/00b7d52da8b1e52d6c000000/Quadratic-programming-for-monotone-control-theoretic-splines.pdf), SICE, 2010.
